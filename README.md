# was-training

## Welcome to my Web Accessibility Training Site

- The point of this site is to record my training methodology and to practice and showcase accessibility code snippets.
- The plan is that this site can be used by others to train for the WAS Certification
- The absolute requirement is that this site is accessible


## Plan A
- To set up the Gatsby.js framework and github repo
- To tackle each principle one at a time delving into the guidelines and the success criteria and then the techniques

## Set up

  * git init
  * git add README.md
  * git commit -m "first commit"
  * git branch -M main
  * git remote add origin https://github.com/kate102/was-training.git
